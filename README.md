ASFScan is a Reddit bot designed to automatically update and maintain a list of Steam package IDs based on user commands in Reddit comments.

## Features
- **License Management**: Processes license commands from Reddit comments to add or update licenses in a Gist.
- **Latest Games Update**: Keeps a Gist updated with the latest 40 unique games.

## How It Works
1. **Comment Monitoring**: The bot continuously checks specified subreddits for new comments containing license commands.
2. **License Processing**: Extracts and processes commands to update the relevant Gist with new licenses.
3. **Gist Updates**: Ensures the Gist content is unique and up-to-date, handling duplicates and conflicts.
